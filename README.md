Thesis abstract:

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions can contribute over 60% to the GHG emissions of a
municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Thus, mitigation of N2O emissions
is important for carbon footprint reduction. This thesis studied the N2O emissions
of Kakolanmäki WWTP and Nenäinniemi WWTP located in Finland. Nitrous oxide
concentrations were measured from the activated sludge processes with an off-gas
hood. Measurement campaigns equal to 15 and 11 days were conducted at both
plants. Nitrous oxide emission factors (EFs) were calculated for each measurement
period, and the dynamics of the off-gas nitrous oxide concentrations were studied.
The results were validated against long-term data from Viikinmäki WWTP.

The EFs for Kakolanmäki WWTP spring and summer measurement campaigns
were 1.7% and 0.09% of total N-load, respectively. The EFs for Nenäinniemi WWTP
were 1.3% and 1.0% of total N-load, respectively.

The off-gas N2O concentration exhibited strong temporal variation also within the
measurement campaigns. The hourly average off-gas N2O concentrations during a
measurement period varied from 6% to 432% of the average concentration. The lowest
concentrations generally occurred 8–10 AM and the highest 8–11PM. Furthermore,
the off-gasN2O concentrations differed significantly between the compartments of an
aeration line. Moderate positive correlation (Pearson’s r=0.57) between the dissolved
nitrite and off-gas nitrous oxide was found.

Water temperature differed significantly between the two measurement periods
at both plants. At Nenäinniemi WWTP, full nitrogen removal was recognized as a
potential N2O mitigation measure during spring and winter season with colder water
temperatures. At Kakolanmäki WWTP, several N2O mitigation measures could be
suggested: increasing COD to N ratio, DO concentration, SRT, and alkalinity.

To estimate the annual average EFs and to study the effects of N2O mitigation
measures, longer campaigns should be conducted with measurements conducted
at several aeration compartments simultaneously. Or in the case of Kakolanmäki
WWTP, which is located inside, plant exhaust gas line N2O concentrations could be
measured.
